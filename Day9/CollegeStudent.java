/*  A HighSchool application has two classes: the Person superclass and the Student subclass. Using
inheritance, in this lab you will create two new classes, Teacher and CollegeStudent. 

A Teacher will be like Person but will have additional properties such as salary (the amount the teacher
earns) and subject (e.g. “Com puter Science”, “Chemistry”, “English”, “Other”). 


The CollegeStudent class will extend the Student class by adding a year (current level in college) and
major (e.g. “Electrical Engineering”, “Communications”, “Undeclared”)*/


class Teacher{
         int salary;
         String Computer_Science;
         String Chemistry;
         String English;
         String biology;
}

class Student{
         
       Sysm.out.println("year is :");
        }
        
class CollegeStudent extends Student{
      void major(){
           System.out.println("Electrical Engineering");
           System.out.println("Communications");
